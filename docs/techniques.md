# Techniques

1.  `amend`.

    Add changes to the previous commit.

2.  `cherry-pick`.

    Apply a given commit to the current branch.  This commit can be any commit
    in the entire repository, in any branch.

3.  `rebase`.

    Re-apply commits on top of another base tip.  I will explain this more
    later.

4.  `interactive rebase`.

    The swiss army knife of rewriting git history.  You can reword messages,
    reorder commits, squash two or more commits together, remove commits, etc.
