# A Bit About Commits and Branches

## What is a commit?

A commit records changes to a repository.  It describes changes from one state
to another state.  As long as git can find the things it needs to change, it
can apply a commit.  If it cannot, it will create a `conflict`.

## What is a git branch?

Simplified, a branch is a list of commits, chained together. It describes
one change to another to another until now.
