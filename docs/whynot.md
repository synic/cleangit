# Why Not

1.  It may be that your team's workflow does not benefit from keeping a shorter
    commit history.
2.  It can be finicky to learn and hard to understand.
3.  You can really screw up your branch, other branches, you can lose commits
    (it has happened to me).
4.  Tendency to squash too much.  A 35 file change with only one commit can
    also be problematic.
